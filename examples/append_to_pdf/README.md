# Code Example for Appending QR Bill to Existing PDF File

This code example shows how to generate a QR bill and append it to an existing PDF file.

Two cases are implemented:

1. The QR bill is added to an existing page. The modified page then contains 
the existing content and the QR bill.

2. A new page is added to the document with the QR bill. The new page only
contains the QR bill.
