## Introduction

The Swiss QR bill is the new QR code based payment format that will replace the current payment slip.
The new payment slip with the QR code is either directly printed at the bottom of an invoice
or added to the invoice on a separate sheet. The payer scans the QR code with his/her mobile banking app
to initiate the payment. No other data needs to be entered. The payment just needs to be confirmed.

The invoicing party can easily synchronize the received payment with the accounts-receivable accounting as
they payment comes with a full set of data including the reference number used on the invoice. So the Swiss QR bill
is convenient for the payer and payee.
